## Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
3. Search for "Copilot Chat History"
4. Click Install

### From GitHub Releases

1. Download the latest `.vsix` file from [Releases](https://github.com/your-username/copilot-chat-history/releases)
2. Open VS Code
3. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
4. Click the "..." menu and select "Install from VSIX..."
5. Select the downloaded file

## Usage

### Viewing Chat History

1. Look for the "Copilot Chat History" icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
2. Click to open the panel
3. Browse your chat sessions organized by workspace
4. Expand/collapse workspaces as needed

### Search and Filter

- Click the search icon (üîç) in the panel header
- Enter keywords to filter chat sessions
- Use the clear filter button (üóëÔ∏è) to reset

### Opening Workspaces

- Use the inline arrow buttons next to workspace names:

### Refreshing

## How it Works

The extension scans your VS Code workspace storage for Copilot chat sessions:

- **Location**: `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage\[workspace-id]\chatSessions\`
- **Grouping**: Sessions are grouped by their associated workspace
- **Titles**: Uses custom titles or generates them from first message
- **Paths**: Resolves workspace paths from stored configuration

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.103.0 or higher
- GitHub Copilot extension (for generating chat sessions)

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

Currently, no additional settings are required. The extension works out of the box.

## Known Issues

- Workspace paths may not resolve correctly if projects have been moved
- Search is case-insensitive and searches in session titles only
- Large numbers of chat sessions may impact performance
